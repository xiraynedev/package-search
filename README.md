# package-search

## See the application live [here](https://package-search.netlify.app/)

This application uses React with TypeScript to search the NPM Registry
for any package names typed in the search field. If packages are found, they are
displayed in a list below the form. The application makes use of the Redux Toolkit to keep
track of state. Styling is handled via Tailwind CSS.
